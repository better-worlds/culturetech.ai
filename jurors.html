Andreea works at the intersection of traditional architecture and immersive tech to develop projects that require a new approach to both cognitive and spatial challenges. Although her work deeply explores profound philosophical dimensions, it is grounded in a highly technical background – she is both an accomplished licensed architect as well as a talented software developer.<br><br>Andreea believes that by expanding the possibilities and affordances of spatial experience, we are expanding and redefining identity, subjectivity and modes of collective being. Andreea’s unique work in exploring the boundaries between physical and virtual spaces is breaking new ground and as such her ideas are in demand in cutting-edge international forums, including recently presenting at SXSW, Germany’s VR Now, and London’s Immersive Architecture of the Internet Symposium.<br><br>Evidence of interest in her work goes beyond the lecture circuit. Andreea’s company, Numena, recently received a 2 million Euro grant to work on behavioral analysis and participatory design using VR with Spectra City. Spectra City is an open-source toolkit and design process where physical place makers and digital world builders work together to create a design depository available to everyone. At its root her work explores the dynamic relationship between mind and world.<br><br>Andreea was formally trained as an architect at MIT and Yale where she was awarded the AIA Gold Medal for best graduating master student by the American Institute of Architects. Prior to NUMENA, she gained design and project management experience in architecture practices such as Kohn Pedersen Fox and Robert A.M. Stern in New York.</p>

Born and raised in Belgium, from an early age Mr. Steinberger’s family instilled in him a deep love of art. Going to art exhibitions and museums wherever they travelled, they also visited artists’ studios and in this way he got to personally know many contemporary artists.<br><br>Mr. Steinberger is a graduate of the Solvay Business School at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. He emigrated to Los Angeles in 1979 with his family and opened a Diamond trading company. However, throughout his life, his passion was art. In the beginning collecting art was just a hobby, but he ended up becoming an art dealer. Marble Arch Fine Arts was founded in 1988. At first it was an open gallery in West Hollywood then in Beverly Hills, and now it is a private gallery open by appointment only.<br><br>Michel Steinberger’s interest in art and collection covers a wide array of periods and schools, from traditional art that includes Old Master paintings ranging from Italian Renaissance, Flemish and Dutch Golden Age (17th century) paintings to 19th century works, to modern art from the first half of the 20th century.

Some of her works have been internationally awarded including at the Black Star Film Festival, Earth Day SF Film Festival, PrideArts Film Fest and many more.<br><br>She co-created an intercultural women’s film collective called Republic of Light, all while living nomadically in a school bus traveling through the Americas for 4+ years. The creative experience generated by living, dreaming and filming collectively left a strong imprint on Mer's way of storytelling. Art for her represents a means of transformation. Her art is at once existential, alive, and subterranean; with subtle choices, she reveals the profundity of alternative narratives subverting reality.<br></p>

For the UN designation, AY was selected from more than 18,000 nominations from 186 nations.  The Energy News Network’s ’40 under 40’ awards program highlights emerging leaders and innovators from across the U.S. and their work in America’s transition to a clean energy economy.<br> <br>As UN Youth leader for SDGs, AY developed ‘Project 17’ a music album based on United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals.  Each of the 17 songs represent a different goal with features from 17 prominent recording artists.  Each song from ‘Project 17’ has a corporate sponsor. Companies including Samsung, Verizon, GM, BNP Parabis Bank, KOKO and ENEL Green Power have all aided in sponsoring a song.  ‘Project 17’ has 17 Impact partners to execute the legacy projects that impact the various SDGs. Organizations including EarthX, Reverb, Oceanic Global, the Regeneration, &amp; Simpliphi Power have partnered with AY &amp; the Battery Tour.<br> <br>While touring the USA, AY learned that globally over 1 billion people lack access to electricity. So AY began powering concerts using renewable energy, raising awareness about sustainability, and fundraising to bring people electricity. Thus, the Battery Tour was born and has plugged in 17 countries to date, while performing over 800 concerts using only battery’s storing energy generated sustainably to power his performance and show production.  <br> <br>AY Young’s Battery Tour is a fresh, imaginative approach uniting musical experience, community development, sustainability education, humanitarian aid, and international cooperation. Battery Tour is a global movement that uses the universal language of music to get people ‘ plugged in’ to sustainability &amp; clean energy solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
